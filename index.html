                <p>
                    Hello! Thanks for visiting my site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Chantel, a soon-to-be new graduate of a BS in Computer Science from University of Washington
                    Tacoma. I
                    love to put a creative spin on things and learn at every opportunity. In my experiences so far, I
                    have
                    especially enjoyed working with full stack and client/server applications, but I am always open to
                    the
                    challenge of learning a new set of skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying Computer Science and Systems at University of Washington Tacoma, graduating
                    spring
                    quarter of 2021.
                    Some of my accomplishments include Deans List, Associate of the Quarter and Associate of the Month
                    at Sysco
                    Food Services, and a Certificate of Excellence in General Sciences at Highline College.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about new experiences, whether it be tackling a unique challenge, traveling to a new
                    place,
                    trying a new food, or coding in a new language. I believe that it is new experiences that enrich
                    life,
                    inspire new ideas, and foster personal growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also passionate about about arts in a variety of mediums and expressions including design,
                    watercolor
                    painting, oil painting, digital art, and film photography. I also enjoy spending time surrounded by
                    the
                    beautiful nature that we are lucky enough to have access to here in the Pacific Northwest.

                <h3>Quick 'N' Easy Recipes - Hackathon Project</h3>
                <p>
                    I collaborated with a team of 4 other students to compete in the <a href="https://uwbhacks.com">UWB
                        Hacks
                        from Home</a> hackathon.
                    The goal of this hackathon was to create something that would assist people working from home.
                    During the pandemic, I started to cook and eat at home more often than ever, but I had difficulty
                    finding
                    recipes with
                    the ingredients I already had, and wanted to eliminate excessive trips to the grocery store. I
                    pitched the
                    idea to my group to
                    create a simple and easy-to-use web application to find recipes based on ingredients and we all
                    agreed to
                    work on this as our
                    project goal. Some of our other goals included using React JS to gain experience with a framework
                    that was
                    new to us, as well as
                    utilizing Microsoft Azure, as they were one fo the hackathon sponsers.

                <h3>@Art_Du_Jour Twitter Bot - Personal Project</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, I was interested in creating a twitter bot which would find art-related tweets and
                    retweet
                    them,
                    in addition to tweet information provided by the Metropolitan Museum of Arts open access database.
                    The bot is running on an AWS EC2 instance and the schedule package initiates the tweets and
                    re-tweets at the
                    appropriate times.

                <h3>Mobile Chat Application</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I worked as the Scrum Master with a group with 3 other students to build a
                    multi-functional
                    chat mobile application for Android that integrates with a PostgreSQL database and includes a web
                    service hosted on
                    Heroku.
                    On the client side, we used Java in the Android Studio development environment.
                    On the server side, we used javascript with node.js and hosted it on Heroku.
                    For the database, we used PostgreSQL.
                </p>
                <p>The application includes the following functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Secure sign-in with jwts and the ability for user to remain logged in</li>
                    <li>Secure registration process with automatic email verification using NodeMailer</li>
                    <li>Ability to detect the device location to provide local weather information</li>
                    <li>Ability for users to search and request to add contacts to their friends list</li>
                    <li>Ability to approve or deny friend requests from other users</li>
                    <li>Ability for users to add friends to a chatroom</li>
                    <li>Ability for users to send live messages to others in the chatroom, with notifications</li>
                    <li>Integrates with Google Maps API to display a map widget that allow the user to select a location
                        on the map to see weather data of
                        that area.</li>
                    <li>Offers user ability to change their password, either within the app or as an external "forgot
                        password"
                        process.</li>
                    <li>Uses Pushy for instant notifications and visibility of new messages or contact requests.</li>
                    <li>Provides weather information by conntecting with external weather API OpenWeatherMap</li>
                    <li>Offers user the ability to change their color scheme within the application.</li>

                <h3>Contact Tracing & Infectious Virus Tracking GUI & SQL Database</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was created to allow medical professionals to perform easily perform CRUD operations to
                    a
                    database using a client application. The database was built to store patient data, medical provider
                    information, medical visit records, potential transmission events, possible contaminees, test
                    results,
                    patient-reported symptoms, and prescriptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application consists of a client side graphical user interface written in Java and a
                    rationalized mySQL database containing 16 different tables. Parameterized database queries were
                    utilized to
                    defend against SQL injection.
